I am a PhD student in the School of Biological Sciences at The University of Queensland. I am interested in how well protected area networks preserve biodiversity processes, and how we can make cost-effective decisions to that preserve these proceses. I am supervised by Dr Richard Fuller and Dr Jonathan Rhodes. Before starting my PhD, I completed my BSc (majoring in ecology) and honours degrees. Later I worked as a research assistant for Jonathan Rhodes on conservation planning in south-east Queensland. I also worked as a research assistant for Richard Fuller on mapping tidal flats along the East Asian-Australasian Flyway.
