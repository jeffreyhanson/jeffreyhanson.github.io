My research concerns the challenges involved in conserving biodiversity. I am interested in understanding how areas can be managed to achieve conservation objectives for minimal cost. In particular, I specialize in operationalizing ecological and evolutionary processes to develop plans for protected area systems that maximize the long-term persistence of biodiversity. I explored this topic in my PhD thesis, entitled "Conserving evolutionary processes", and you can hear more about in the recording of my exit seminar below.
