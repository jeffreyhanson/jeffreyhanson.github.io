I am a conservation scientist. I'm interested in solving the challenges that prevent us from creating cost-effective plans to conserve biodiversity. My research focuses on applying optimization algorithms to solve conservation problems, leveraging novel datasets to better inform conservation decision making, and identifying cost-effective surrogate data that can inform conservation decisions when high quality expensive data are not available. I also develop decision support tools to help others apply my findings to their own work (e.g., [prioritizr](https://prioritizr.net), [raptr](http://jeffrey-hanson.com/raptr/), [oppr](https://prioritizr.github.io/oppr/), and [wdpar](https://prioritizr.github.io/wdpar/) R packages). At Carleton University, I am currently working to optimise the allocation of resources for establishing new protected areas and survey programmes from a shared budget. I hope to provide guidelines that conservation practitioners can use when deciding which places to survey to maximize biodiversity persistence.
