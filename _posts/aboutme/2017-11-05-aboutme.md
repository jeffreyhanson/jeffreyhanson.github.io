| My research concerns the challenges involved in conserving biodiversity. I am interested in understanding how areas can be managed to achieve conservation objectives for minimal cost. In particular, I specialize in operationalizing ecological and evolutionary processes to develop plans for protected area systems that maximize the long-term persistence of biodiversity. I explored this topic in my PhD thesis, entitled "Conserving evolutionary processes", and you can learn more about it by watching a recording of my exit seminar below. | <iframe width="554" height="405" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dkkqXo8Z17w" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe> |
