I am a conservation scientist. I'm interested in solving the challenges that prevent us from creating strategic plans to effectively conserve biodiversity. My research focuses on incorporating novel datasets into conservation planning exercises (e.g. establishing new protected areas), applying optimisation algorithms to find optimal solutions to conservation problems, and identifying cost-effective surrogate data that can inform conservation decisions when high quality expensive data are not available (e.g. genetic data). I also develop decision support tools to help others apply my findings to their own work (e.g. [prioritizr](https://prioritizr.net), [raptr](http://jeffrey-hanson.com/raptr/), [oppr](https://prioritizr.github.io/oppr/) R packages). In my doctoral thesis, entitled "Conserving evolutionary processes", I operationalized ecological and evolutionary processes to develop plans for protected area systems that maximize the long-term persistence of biodiversity (watch the recording of my exit seminar below). At the University of Carleton, I am currently working to optimise the allocation of resources for establishing new protected areas and survey programmes from a shared budget. I hope to provide guidelines that conservation practitioners can use when deciding which places to survey to maximize biodiversity persistence.
