I am a conservation scientist. I'm interested in helping people make better conservation decisions. My research focuses on applying optimization algorithms to solve problems in conservation (e.g., [allocating funds for recovery projects](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13264) or [identifying priority areas for protection](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2138-7)), leveraging novel datasets to better inform conservation decision making (e.g., [using genetic data to prioritize conservation efforts](https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.13315)), and identifying cost-effective surrogate data that can inform conservation decisions when high quality expensive data are not available (e.g., [using environmental data as a proxy for genetic data](https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1711009114)). I also develop decision support tools to help others apply my findings to their own work (e.g., [prioritizr](https://prioritizr.net), [raptr](http://jeffrey-hanson.com/raptr/), [oppr](https://prioritizr.github.io/oppr/), and [wdpar](https://prioritizr.github.io/wdpar/) R packages). At Carleton University, I am currently working to optimise the allocation of resources for establishing new protected areas and survey programmes from a shared budget. I hope to provide guidelines that conservation practitioners can use when deciding which places to survey to maximize biodiversity persistence.
