I am a conservation scientist, currently living in Palmerston North, New Zealand. I work remotely as a postdoctoral researcher in the [Bennett Lab at Carleton University, Ottawa](https://carleton.ca/bennett-lab/). I'm interested in helping people make better conservation decisions. My research focuses on applying optimization algorithms to solve problems in conservation (e.g., [allocating funds for recovery projects](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13264) or [identifying priority areas for protection](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2138-7)), leveraging novel datasets to better inform conservation decision making (e.g., [using genetic data to prioritize conservation efforts](https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.13718)), and identifying cost-effective surrogate data to inform conservation decisions when high quality data are not available (e.g., [using environmental data as a proxy for genetic data](https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1711009114)). I also develop decision support tools to help others apply my findings in their own work (e.g., [prioritizr](https://prioritizr.net), [raptr](http://jeffrey-hanson.com/raptr/), [oppr](https://prioritizr.github.io/oppr/), [surveyvoi](https://prioritizr.github.io/surveyvoi) and [wdpar](https://prioritizr.github.io/wdpar/) R packages). Please reach out if you'd like to chat about my research or have any questions about the decision support tools I've helped develop.
