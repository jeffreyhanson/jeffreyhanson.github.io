I finished my PhD at the School of Biological Sciences, The University of Queensland. I developed new methods for explicitly incorporating evolutionary processes into conservation planning, examined potential surrogates for guiding reserve selection when genetic data are not available, and examined how well the global protected area system may be representing the habitats that promote adaptation in nearly 20 thousand vertebrate species. My supervisors were Richard Fuller and Jonathan Rhodes.
