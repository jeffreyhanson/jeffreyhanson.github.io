The oppr R package is decision support tool for prioritizing conservation projects. Prioritizations can be developed by maximizing expected feature richness, expected phylogenetic diversity, the number of features that meet persistence targets, or identifying a set of projects that meet persistence targets for minimal cost. Constraints (e.g. lock in specific actions) and feature weights can also be specified to further customize prioritizations. After defining a project prioritization problem, solutions can be obtained using exact algorithms, heuristic algorithms, or random processes. In particular, it is recommended to install the ‘Gurobi’ optimizer because it can identify optimal solutions very quickly. Finally, methods are provided for comparing different prioritizations and evaluating their benefits. You can learn more about it at the [package website](https://prioritizr.github.io/oppr) or by reading [our paper published in Methods in Ecology and Evolution](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13264). Download the [official version from CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/oppr/index.html), or the [developmental version from GitHub](https://github.com/prioritizr/oppr).
