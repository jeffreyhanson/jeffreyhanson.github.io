The `marxan` R package provides a programmatic interface to the Marxan decision support tool. Conservation planners can use this R package to generate input data for Marxan using raw inputs, run Marxan, and investigate solutions. Many of the computationally intensive tasks have been written in C++ to reduce run time.
