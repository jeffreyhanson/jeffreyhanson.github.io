The raptr R package can be used to generate plans for protected areas (prioritizations) using spatially explicit targets for biodiversity patterns and processes. To obtain solutions in a feasible amount of time, this package uses the [commercial 'Gurobi' software package](http://www.gurobi.com/). Download the [official version from CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raptr/index.html), or the [developmental version from GitHub](https://github.com/jeffreyhanson/raptr).
