Biodiversity is in crisis. The overarching aim of conservation is to preserve biodiversity patterns and processes. To this end, protected areas are established to buffer species and preserve biodiversity processes. But resources are limited and so protected areas must be cost-effective. This R package contains tools to generate plans for protected areas (prioritizations), using spatially explicit targets for biodiversity patterns and processes. To obtain solutions in a feasible amount  of time, this package uses the [commercial 'Gurobi' software package](http://www.gurobi.com/). Additionally, the ['rgurobi' package](http://github.com/jeffreyhanson/rgurobi) can also be installed to provide extra functionality. Download the [official version from CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/raptr/index.html), or the [developmental version from GitHub](https://github.com/jeffreyhanson/raptr).
