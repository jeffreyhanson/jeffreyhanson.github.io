The surveyvoi R package is a decision support tool for prioritizing sites for ecological surveys based on their potential to improve plans for conserving biodiversity (e.g. plans for establishing protected areas). Given a set of sites that could potentially be acquired for conservation management -- wherein some sites have previously been surveyed and other sites have not -- this package provides functionality to generate and evaluate plans for additional surveys. Specifically, plans for ecological surveys can be generated using various conventional approaches (e.g. maximizing expected species richness, geographic coverage, diversity of sampled environmental conditions) and by maximizing value of information. After generating plans for surveys, they can also be evaluated using value of information analysis. Download the [official version from CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/surveyvoi/index.html), or the [developmental version from GitHub](https://github.com/prioritizr/surveyvoi).
