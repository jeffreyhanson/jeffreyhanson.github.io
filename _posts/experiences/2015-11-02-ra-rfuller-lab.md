I was primarily responsible for producing tidal flat maps for the East-Australasian Flyway. To acheive this, I compiled databases of LANDSAT satellite images and processed spatial data. This work resulted in the upcomming publication Djhanal-Adams _et al._ (under revision). Additionally, during this time I helped compile a global database of protected areas using data from the World Database on Protected Areas and additional sources.
