My primary role was data preparation and analysis. I assisted with preparing genetic and spatial data for landscape genetics analysis. I generated connectivity models for Sugar Gliders, Squirrel Gliders, and the Yellow Footed Antechinus using landscape and genetic data. Additionally, I developed a decision support tool to help understand the impacts of development on the connecitivity of these species in South East Queensland, Australia. This work resulted in the upcomming publication Dudaneic _et al._ (accepted 2015).
