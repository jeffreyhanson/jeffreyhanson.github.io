I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher on the Next Generation Conservation project in the BIODESERTS group at CIBIO/InBIO. I am assessing how well existing protected areas in Portugal and Spain are representing the evolutionary processes for three endemic amphibian species (_Hyla molleri_, _Pelobates cultripes_, and _Rana iberica_) and identifying priorities for addressing shortfalls. I am also evaluating potential surrogates for representing genetic diversity in plans for protected area systems when genetic data are not available.
