I worked on the Next Generation Conservation project in the BIODESERTS group at CIBIO/InBIO. I assessed how well existing protected areas in Portugal and Spain are representing the evolutionary processes for three endemic amphibian species (_Hyla molleri_, _Pelobates cultripes_, and _Rana iberica_) and identified priorities for addressing shortfalls. I also evaluated potential surrogates for representing genetic diversity in plans for protected area systems when genetic data are not available.
