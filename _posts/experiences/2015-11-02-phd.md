I am currently a PhD candidate in the School of Biological Sciences at The University of Queensland. I am investigating how we can explictly include biodiversity processes in the conservation planning process, and how plans for reserve networks (prioritisations) change when we do explicitly consider them. I am supervised by Richard Fuller and Jonathan Rhodes.
