I developed software for the Field Ecology course (BIOL2015). During the course students would visit Fraser Island and collect data using applications on smart phones. I wrote a [data formatting tool](https://github.com/jeffreyhanson/data-formatter-biol2015) to streamline the process of harvesting and validating the data from the smart phones. This program also prepared the data for statistical analysis. Additionally, I wrote a [data visualization tool](https://github.com/jeffreyhanson/data-viewer-biol2015) to help students visualize patterns in the data they collected. I have contributed to the further development of these tools on-and-off over the last few years.
