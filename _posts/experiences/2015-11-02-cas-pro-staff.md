I developed programs for the Field Ecology course (BIOL2015). During the course students would visit Fraser Island and collect data using purpose-build apps on smartphones. I wrote a [data formatting program](https://github.com/paleo13/data-formatter-biol2015) to streamline the process of formatting data output from the apps for statistical analysis, and identifying potential issues with the data. Additionally, I wrote a [data visualisation program](https://github.com/paleo13/data-viewer-biol2015) to provide a simple interface for visualising their results. I have contributed to the further development of these programs on-and-off over the last few years.
