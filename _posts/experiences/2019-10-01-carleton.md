I am currently working to optimise the allocation of resources for establishing new conservation areas and survey programmes from a shared budget. Conservation practitioners are often faced with the difficult decision of acting with limited data, or collecting more data to create more effective conservation plans. Acting with limited data means that more resources are available for directly conserving biodiversity -- since no resources are spent collecting more data -- but could also mean that these resources are poorly allocated. On the other hand, collecting more data could result in more effective conservation plans but also means that fewer resources are available for actually conserving biodiversity. I hope to provide guidelines that conservation practitioners can use when deciding which places to survey so they can use remaining funds to establish protected areas in the places that will maximize biodiversity persistence.
